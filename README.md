## About Me
Supported by a 10+ year client-facing career in creative advertising and a graduate from Makers, one of the most distinguished bootcamps in the UK.

I'm looking for a new challenge as a full-stack engineer, after spending the first part of my career working to a senior level at ad agencies across two continents. I'm intrinsically motivated by the everyday **problem-solving** required to be developer, but especially driven to create user-centric programs that will improve people's lives.

The discipline, responsibility and attention to detail required from my career so far, paired with my natural empathy, **problem-solving** & logic provide a good basis to be a junior developer who will be able to learn quickly and flourish in any environment. I'm especially looking for a role with strong employee support and mentorship.

From August - December 2022 I studied at Makers, a bootcamp for developers, where I have learnt the fundamentals of software development, building practical skills through projects, and working with other students in pairs & groups to simulate real-life working scenarios.

## Skills

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?

**Well-rounded project management**
I headed up AAMI’s sponsorships at Ogilvy Melbourne, notably their annual, multi-million dollar sponsorship of the AFL (Aussie Rules). Building on my partnership experience, this role required delicate and collaborative management skills to navigate layers of stakeholders via our client & agency village, the broadcaster & the league itself to ensure our creative vision was being delivered whilst still hitting their goals. 2021 was our most effective season to date, elevating AAMI's presence to become synonymous with the footy.

**Creating Business Efficiency**
In leading AAMI’s social media, I spear-headed a move away from a high-churn, low-impact content calendar to a quarterly briefing approach, ensuring every campaign delivers against their overarching KPIs. This created value for my clients and fewer, more interesting projects for my internal teams, reducing team impact and fatigue. It also delivered consistently improved results over 3 years, with high-scoring nationwide & sector-leading results.

**Delivering Innovation**
Throughout my career, but notably at The Outfit, I have had a demonstrable interest in delivering innovative campaigns for my clients. Whether it's creating live stunts in TV ad-breaks for Assassin's Creed or Cannes award-winning, data-driven road safety campaigns to reduce driver fatigue, I've been drawn to anything that's new & difficult. Whilst rewarding, these projects require single-minded dedication and demand the most of my organizational, problem-solving skillset to tackle challenges that don't have a pre-existing path.

**Fast Learner**
Having not worked in social before, I was tasked with developing giffgaff's lead.... I quickly taught myself how the back-end of Facebook worked, as well as how to create stand-out 

**Calm Presence**
My time at the Outfit, and as a freelancer, required me to hit the ground running on new clients to quickly gain an in-depth understanding of the challenges their businesses faced, what problems needed to be solved and, more often than not, the culture that needed to shift. I gained a reputation for quickly develop trusting relationships with my clients in order to make an impact. It has meant that wherever I've freelanced, I've been offered a contract extension, with my manager nicknaming me "the client whisperer" due to my calm and reassuring presence.
