## ABOUT ME
With over a decade of experience working to a senior level in advertising across two continents, I felt ready for a new challenge and a new career. Software development has been the ideal career to explore further because it fits well with my natural skillset. Combining my creative background with my problem-solving brain, as well as bringing my well-honed business acumen & soft skills to a new role.

I built my coding credentials at Makers Academy, a highly-respected full-stack bootcamp, from where I graduated in December 2022. Here I learned the fundamentals of software development, building practical skills and working on a portfolio of projects (such as [this](https://youtu.be/jNPUt79UpsA?t=134)). A key focus of the course was working with other students in pairs & groups, both in-person and remotely, to simulate real-life team & work setups. I enjoyed and excelled in the course, and I am ready to continue with my perfect career 2.0.

Coding and the tech world also really excite me on a personal level. I enjoy the practice, even at its most frustrating, and relish being 'in the zone'. I like to consider how programs I'll develop will impact user's lives, and I'd love to work for a company that either creates a product that enhances a user's experience of life, or improves lives through tech for good.

The discipline, responsibility and attention to detail required from my career to date, paired with my natural empathic, analytical, logical approach provides a good basis for me to flourish as a junior developer, able to learn quickly and improve almost any working environment. I'd be keen to find a role that reciprocates what I have to offer, by demonstrating a focus on employee development, support and mentorship.

## SKILLS

#### Well-rounded communicator, team leader & project manager
_During my career_, I headed up AAMI insurance's sponsorships at [Ogilvy Melbourne](ogilvy-melbourne), notably their annual, multi-million dollar sponsorship of the AFL (Aussie Rules Football). This role required delicate and collaborative management skills to navigate layers of stakeholders via our client & agency 'village', the broadcaster & the league itself to ensure our creative vision was being delivered whilst still hitting their goals. 2021 was our most effective season to date, elevating AAMI's presence to become synonymous with the footy.

_As a developer_, during all projects, but especially in the [grumblebook](https://github.com/eggs-benny/grumbleBook---an-acebook-facebook-clone) project, I ensured our team stuck to the Agile approach. This gave us the flexibility to adapt the project as we hit blockages, and I pushed for changing team resourcing to ensure the most important features were delivered and production ready.

#### Fast Learner
_During my career_, having not worked in social media before, and working in-house at [giffgaff](giffgaff) (a UK telco) I was tasked with improving their lead generating social adverts. I quickly taught myself how the back-end of Facebook & Instagram's ad platforms worked (i.e. how to plan & buy ads), as well as using online resources and Facebook workshops on how to create stand-out creative. The new ads achieved best in class results that year, based on Facebook's benchmarks.

_As a developer_, I went from almost no coding experience to working with APIs with Ruby in just 8 weeks. I then translated this knowledge to become similarly proficient in JavaScript in just an additional 2 weeks. Over the recent Christmas break, I self-taught myself TypeScript.

#### Creating Business Efficiency
_During my career_, In leading [AAMI insuranceâ€™s](ogilvy-melbourne) social media advertising, I spear-headed a move away from high-churn, low-impact content to a quarterly briefing approach, and a judgement criteria, ensuring campaigns delivered against their overarching KPIs. This created better value for my clients, fewer, more interesting projects for my creative teams to work on (reducing team impact and fatigue) and more enjoyable content for our audience. Over the 3 years I worked on the brand, the results significantly improved year on year, ending with very high-scoring nationwide & sector-leading results.

_As a developer_, whilst I haven't had a chance to test out my business efficiency yet, I've already found that my desire for simplicity means I have an eye for developing efficient programs. This can been demonstrated in how I approached and simplified the [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/eggs-benny/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) kata.

#### Delivering Innovation
_During my career_, notably at The Outfit, I have had a demonstrable interest in delivering innovative campaigns. Whether it's creating live stunts in TV ad-breaks for [Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p87bJx5Dxzo) or [Cannes Gold award-winning](https://www.adnews.com.au/news/gold-lion-for-ogilvy-australia), data-driven road safety campaigns to reduce driver fatigue, I've been drawn to anything that's new & challenging. Whilst rewarding, these projects require single-minded dedication and demand the most of my organizational, problem-solving skillset to tackle challenges that don't have a pre-existing path.

_As a developer_, in our final project at Makers, I wanted to build something different from what we'd seen before. With the group aligned, we therefore developed Votewatch, an app that gives the user the ability to see how their MP votes in the House of Commons, using the Commons API. This was the first time Makers students had created an app like this or used this kind of API. I also ensured that we pitched our presentation differently to our teams; as a product launch, rather than a project re-cap.

#### Calm head & empathetic presence
_During my career_ both as a freelancer, but also in other roles, I had to hit the ground running with new clients to quickly gain an in-depth understanding of the challenges their businesses faced, what problems needed to be solved and the culture that needed to shift. I have a reputation as _"the client whisperer"_ due to my calm and reassuring presence, and for quickly developing trusting relationships with my clients & colleagues in order to deliver interesting work while also beating business KPIs.

_As a developer_, towards the end of our final project at Makers, behind schedule and with several large features still to be to be included in our beta, I took the reins as the team's _'merge master'_. Drawing on a decade of tight-deadlines, I knew that by keeping everyone calm and taking a systematic approach to merging, we would ensure all features worked. Despite an early-hours finish, a team-mate & I got the app working, as well as writing the presentation, ready to [show off](https://youtu.be/jNPUt79UpsA?t=134) the next day.

## EXPERIENCE

#### Makers Academy (August 2022 - December 2022)
A selective 16-week bootcamp, one of the best in Europe with a 10% acceptance rate; designed to make students job ready for junior dev roles.

##### Skills developed
- **Test Driven Development:** Learning TDD means I will approach code scientifically & behaviour-first, using integration and unit testing. Testing experience using RSpec, Jest & Cypress.
- **OOD & SOLID principles:** To ensure our code was clean, readable & easier to debug and refactor ([example](https://github.com/eggs-benny/bank_tech_test)).
- **Databases:** Building databases and Create, Read, Update & Delete data using Postman, Postgresql, Sequelize, MongoDB & Ruby ORM.
- **APIs:** Leveraging existing APIs (such as the Guardian or House of Commons) to power apps & webapps we built, as well as learning how to set up our own APIs.
- **Full-stack environment:** We learnt to build both solo and group projects with functional front and back ends using stacks such as [MERN](https://github.com/eggs-benny/grumbleBook---an-acebook-facebook-clone) & [SERN](https://github.com/tomallens/votewatch).
- **Language agnostic approach:** Although we developed in Ruby & JavaScript to a high standard, plus a supporting tech stack, we were also shown how to self-learn new languages and frameworks in short timescales.
- **Agile:** Developing & practising an Agile workflow on team projects using in-depth planning (e.g. Excalidraw), tickets (Trello), sprints, retros (Miro), daily stand-ups and learning to adapt a project with time.
- **Goal-directed learning:** Learning _how_ to learn was the actually most important lesson from this course. Setting goals, monitoring progress (in daily stand-ups) & reflecting (in weekly retros) made this learning experience efficient, enjoyable & effective.
- **Teamwork & Collaboration:** Daily pair programming & team projects made up the majority of the course. Which showed us that working closely and collaboratively is often the most effective way to code.
