## About Me
With over a decade of experience working to a senior level in advertising across two continents, I felt ready for a new challenge and a new career. By combining my creative background with my problem-solving brain, as well as bringing my well-honed soft-skills to a new role, becoming a developer felt like the ideal career to explore further.

I am a recent graduate from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/), a highly-respected UK bootcamp. Here I learned the fundamentals of software development, honing practical skills and building a portfolio through projects (such as [this](https://youtu.be/jNPUt79UpsA?t=134)). As well as working with other students in pairs & groups, both in-person and remotely to simulate real-life software career setups - all of which has made me certain that this my perfect career 2.0.

The discipline, responsibility and attention to detail required from my career to date, paired with my natural empathic, analytical, logical approach provides a good basis to be a junior developer, able to learn quickly and flourish in any environment.

I'd like to work for companies that build user-centric products that improve people's lives, or create tech for good. I'm also very keen to find a role that offers strong employee development, support and mentorship.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner
_As a developer_, I went from almost no coding experience to working with APIs with Ruby in 8 weeks. I then translated this knowledge to become similarly proficient in Javascript in just an additional 2 weeks. Over the Christmas break, I self-taught myself TypeScript.

_During my career_, having not worked in social media before, I was tasked with improving giffgaff's lead generating social adverts. I quickly taught myself how the back-end of Facebook/Instagram's ad platform worked (i.e. how to plan & buy ads), as well as using online resources and Facebook workshops on how to create stand-out creative. The new ads achieved best in class results that year, based on Facebook's benchmarks.

#### Well-rounded project management
_During my career_, I headed up AAMI's sponsorships at Ogilvy Melbourne, notably their annual, multi-million dollar sponsorship of the AFL (Aussie Rules). This role required delicate and collaborative management skills to navigate layers of stakeholders via our client & agency village, the broadcaster & the league itself to ensure our creative vision was being delivered whilst still hitting their goals. 2021 was our most effective season to date, elevating AAMI's presence to become synonymous with the footy.

_As a developer_, I worked with my team using an Agile approach.............

#### Creating Business Efficiency
In leading AAMI insuranceâ€™s social media advertising, I spear-headed a move away from high-churn, low-impact content to a quarterly briefing approach, and a judgement criteria, ensuring campaigns delivered against their overarching KPIs. This created better value for my clients, fewer, more interesting projects for my creative teams to work on (thus reducing team impact and fatigue) and more enjoyable content for our audience. Over the 3 years I worked on the brand, the results improved significantly year on year, ending with very high-scoring nationwide & sector-leading results.

#### Delivering Innovation
_During my career_, notably at The Outfit, I have had a demonstrable interest in delivering innovative campaigns. Whether it's creating live stunts in TV ad-breaks for [Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p87bJx5Dxzo) or [Cannes award-winning](https://www.adnews.com.au/news/gold-lion-for-ogilvy-australia), data-driven road safety campaigns to reduce driver fatigue, I've been drawn to anything that's new & challenging. Whilst rewarding, these projects require single-minded dedication and demand the most of my organizational, problem-solving skillset to tackle challenges that don't have a pre-existing path.

_As a developer_, in our final project at Makers, we wanted to build something innovative. We therefore developed Votewatch, an app that 

#### Calm head & calming Presence
_During my career_ both as a freelancer, but also in other roles, I had to hit the ground running on with new clients to quickly gain an in-depth understanding of the challenges their businesses faced, what problems needed to be solved and the culture that needed to shift. I have a reputation as "the client whisperer" due to my calm and reassuring presence, and for quickly developing trusting relationships with my clients in order to make an impact.

_As a developer_, in the last days of our final project at Makers, behind schedule and with several large features still to be to be included in our beta, I became the team's 'merge master'. Drawing on a decade of tight-deadlines, I knew that by keeping everyone calm and taking a systematic approach to merging, we would ensure all features worked. Despite an early-hours finish, we got the app working and ready to [present](https://youtu.be/jNPUt79UpsA?t=134) the next day.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (August 2022 - December 2022)
A selective 16-week bootcamp, one of the best in Europe with a 10% acceptance rate; designed to make students oven-ready for junior dev roles.

##### Hard skills
- Test Driven Development: Learning TDD means I will approach code scientifically & behaviour-first, using integration and unit testing. Testing experience using RSpec, Jest & Cypress.
- OOD & SOLID principles: To ensure our code was clean, readable & easier to debug and refactor ([example](https://github.com/eggs-benny/bank_tech_test))
- Databases: Building databases and Create, Read, Update & Delete data using Postman, Postgresql, MongoDB & Ruby ORM.
- APIs: Leveraging existing APIs (such as the Guardian or House of Commons) to power apps & webapps we built, as well as learning how to set up our own 
- Full-stack environment: We learnt to build both solo and group projects with functional front and back ends using stacks such as [MERN] [https://github.com/eggs-benny/grumbleBook---an-acebook-facebook-clone] & [SERN] [https://github.com/tomallens/votewatch].

##### Soft Skills
- Language agnostic approach: Although we developed in Ruby & Javascript to a high standard, plus a supporting tech stack, we were also shown how to self-learn new languages and frameworks in short timescales.
- Agile: Developing & practising an Agile workflow on team projects using in-depth planning (e.g. Excalidraw), tickets (Trello), sprints, retros (Miro), daily standups and learning to adapt a project with time.
- Goal-directed learning: Learning _how_ to learn was the actually most important lesson from this course. Setting goals, monitoring progress (in daily stand-ups) & reflecting (in weekly retros) made this learning experience efficient, enjoyable & effective.
- Teamwork & Collaboration: Daily pair programming & team projects made up the majority of the course. Which showed us that working closely and collaboratively is often the most effective way to code.


#### University of Nottingham (September 2006 - June 2009)
