## Benedict Smith
I'm looking for a new challenge as a junior developer, after spending over a decade working in advertising in the UK & Australia. I'm intrinsically rewarded by the everyday problem-solving required to be developer, but I'm especially motivated to create user-centric programs that will improve people's lives.

Since August 2022 I have been studying at Makers Academy, a bootcamp for developers, where I have been learning fundamentals of software development, building practical skills through projects and working with other students.

I feel that my that the discipline, responsibility and attention to detail required from my career so far, paired with my natural empathy, problem-solving, logic skills provide a good basis to have as a junior developer who will flourish in any environment. I'm especially looking for a role with strong employee support and mentorship.

**Well-rounded communicator**
While at Ogilvy Melboune, I headed up AAMI’s annual major sponsorship of the AFL. I led the strategy, development & production of annual multi-million dollar integrated TV campaigns. Building on previous partnership experience, this role required delicate and collaborative stakeholder communication skills. We delivered our most effective season to date last year, with our route to success driven by me ensuring all stakeholders talk & work together, and ensuring all parties' needs were met.

**Delivering Business Efficiency**
In leading AAMI’s social media, I spear-headed a move away from a high-churn, low-impact content calendar to a quarterly briefing approach, ensuring every campaign delivers against their overarching KPIs. This created value for my clients and fewer, more interesting projects for my internal teams, reducing team impact and fatigue. It also delivered consistently improved results over 3 years, with high-scoring nationwide & sector-leading results.

Cool under pressure
McDonald’s ‘McCafé Moments’ was a highly successful campaign that I led from inception. Originally planned as a 1-year campaign, we delivered so strongly against its KPIs, on a comparatively shoestring budget, that we ensured a 2nd year and a lucrative relationship opening up future briefs. We built a low cost-per-deliverable TVC production model that allowed us to create nearly 70 hyper-contextual spots over the campaign period. The campaign went on to win gold at the 2015 MediaWeek awards.


Delivering Innovation
Throughout my career I've been interested in delivering innovative campaigns for my clients. Whether it's creating live-cross TV ad-breaks on Channel 4 for Assassin's Creed and Sam Smith or data-driven road safety campaigns to reduce driver fatigue.....
**
Channel 4, my main client while at the Outfit, is at TV's cutting edge. So we consistently needed to deliver ground-breaking campaigns in their partnership advertising space. Amongst other innovative projects, I delivered several live ad-break takeovers, including a death-defying 100ft leap to launch the Assassin’s Creed movie and broadcasting a live Sam Smith gig during an ad-break. As these all carried huge risks, they pushed my organizational skills to the limit as we prepared for every potential outcome.
**


Fast learner
My time as a freelancer, leading into my permanent role at Ogilvy Melbourne required me to hit the ground running on clients I had no prior knowledge of to quickly gain an understanding of the problems the businesses faced, why they needed me, and to quickly develop relationships with my clients

I earned a full-time offer at Bank of America Merrill Lynch by impressing my line manager with how quickly I picked up an understanding of finance and the technologies that the team used, despite having a scientific background and no previous experience in finance. For our Makersbnb project, I learnt Node.js and Express without it being taught on the course and used it to build a fully-functioning Airbnb-style website in a week.

Analytical thinker
In my role at Bank of America, I analysed new market data on a daily basis to generate trade ideas. Furthermore, I undertook a project to migrate all of our systems and trade history to a new legal entity. This required careful risk analysis which ensured there was no negative P&L impact on completion.
