## About Me
After more than a decade working to a senior level in TV advertising across two continents, I was ready for a new career and a new challenge. Looking to combine my creative background with my problem-solving brain, as well as bringing my well-honed soft-skills to a new role, becoming a developer felt like the ideal career to explore further.

I am a recent graduate from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/), a highly-respected UK bootcamp, which has helped me develop the fundamentals of software development, honing practical skills and a portfolio through projects (such as [this](https://youtu.be/jNPUt79UpsA?t=134)). As well as working with other students in pairs & groups to simulate real-life working setups - all of which has made me certain that this is the perfect career 2.0 for me.

The discipline, responsibility and attention to detail required from my career to date, paired with my natural empathic, analytical, logical approach provides a good basis to be a junior developer who will be able to learn quickly and flourish in any environment.

I'm especially looking for a role that creates user-centric products, that will improve people's lives, as well as companies that offer strong employee support and mentorship.

## Skills

#### Well-rounded project management
_As a developer_

_In my career_ I headed up AAMI’s sponsorships at Ogilvy Melbourne, notably their annual, multi-million dollar sponsorship of the AFL (Aussie Rules). Building on my partnership experience, this role required delicate and collaborative management skills to navigate layers of stakeholders via our client & agency village, the broadcaster & the league itself to ensure our creative vision was being delivered whilst still hitting their goals. 2021 was our most effective season to date, elevating AAMI's presence to become synonymous with the footy.

#### Creating Business Efficiency
In leading AAMI’s social media, I spear-headed a move away from a high-churn, low-impact content calendar to a quarterly briefing approach, ensuring every campaign delivers against their overarching KPIs. This created value for my clients and fewer, more interesting projects for my internal teams, reducing team impact and fatigue. It also delivered consistently improved results over 3 years, with high-scoring nationwide & sector-leading results.

#### Delivering Innovation
Throughout my career, but notably at The Outfit, I have had a demonstrable interest in delivering innovative campaigns for my clients. Whether it's creating live stunts in TV ad-breaks for Assassin's Creed or Cannes award-winning, data-driven road safety campaigns to reduce driver fatigue, I've been drawn to anything that's new & difficult. Whilst rewarding, these projects require single-minded dedication and demand the most of my organizational, problem-solving skillset to tackle challenges that don't have a pre-existing path.

#### Fast Learner
_As a developer_ I went from no coding experience to working with APIs with Ruby in 8 weeks, and translated this knowledge to Javascript in just 2 weeks.

_In my career_ having not worked in social before, I was tasked with developing giffgaff's lead.... I quickly taught myself how the back-end of Facebook worked, as well as how to create stand-out 

#### Calm Presence
_As a developer_

_In my career_ both as a freelancer, but also in other roles, I had to hit the ground running on with new clients to quickly gain an in-depth understanding of the challenges their businesses faced, what problems needed to be solved and the culture that needed to shift. I have a reputation as "the client whisperer" due to my calm and reassuring presence, and for quickly developing trusting relationships with my clients in order to make an impact.
